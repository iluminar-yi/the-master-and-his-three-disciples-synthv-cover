This work uses [`synthv-utils`](https://github.com/iluminar-yi/synthv-utils) to facilitate production and
to prettify the `.s5p` project file to make it more readable.

This is a `git` repo, which means you can navigate to a previous version of the project easily.
I have created tags along this process, so that you can check out the tag and listen to what it sounded like.
For example:
```bash
git checkout add-timbre-params
```
The list of tags are visible in multiple place, including 
[Releases](https://github.com/iluminar-yi/the-master-and-his-three-disciples-synthv-cover/releases).
